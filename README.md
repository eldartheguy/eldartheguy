Hi, I’m Eldar Maman and i love programming!
 
I’m interested in a lot of different subjects, the main ones are automation, AI & Machine Learning and game development.

I’m currently studying maths and expanding my knowledge in python libraries and SQL.
 
You can reach me on eldar2maman@gmail if you would like to collaborate or for any other reason.
